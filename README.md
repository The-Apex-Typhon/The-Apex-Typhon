- Hello, I'm The Apex Typhon, or Typhon/Apex for short, hope you're doing well!
- I enjoy coding in Lua/gLua and occasionally C++ and Csharp.
- I’m currently trying to improve m Lua skills by working with some friends on a project.
- I'm not looking to collaborate at the moment as my hands are full.
- If for some reason you want to contact me, go ahead! My Steam name is The Apex Typhon and my discord is The Apex Typhon#4208 now, please be normal in DMs/Steam or you will be instantly blocked.
